      Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. Those great big fluffy clouds.
      Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? I'll
      go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green,
      Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow,
      and Permanent red.

      Do an almighty painting with us. In your world you have total and absolute
      power. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. There's not a
      thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. That's what makes life
      fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that
      you want.

      As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. I started painting as a
      hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent
      is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. The little tiny Tim
      easels will let you down.

      little tree out of your brush like that.

      A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. If you've been in Alaska less
      than a year you're a Cheechako. So often we avoid running water, and
      running water is a lot of fun.
